# MobileImpact Donor Analytics
## Data-Driven Engagement Strategy to Reduce Churn and Optimise Revenue

## Executive Summary
MobileImpact faced uneven donor engagement across traditional and in-app channels. High-value in-app donors (“whales”) generated 85.6% of revenue but were at risk of disengagement, while one-time and younger donors lacked personalised nurturing.

I led an analytics intervention that integrated five datasets to segment donors, predict churn risk, and design behaviour-driven, AI-assisted engagement strategies. Key tactical initiatives included: **genre-aligned messaging for younger in-app donors, behaviour-based reminders for high-value app donors, and predictive RFM alert tiers for traditional donors**. These recommendations were privacy-compliant, actionable, and designed to improve retention, optimise campaign efficiency, and protect high-value revenue.

This project demonstrates my ability to **translate complex data into concrete, revenue-impacting engagement strategies**.

## Broken Decision / Business Problem
The client relied on uniform engagement campaigns and generic messaging, treating all donors within a channel the same.

Consequences included:  
- Over-engagement of high-value in-app donors, risking fatigue and churn  
- Under-engagement of promising or younger donors, missing growth opportunities  
- Inefficient channel allocation, with email, social media, and direct mail underutilised strategically  

Without intervention, revenue concentration on a small donor segment created long-term sustainability risk, and campaign ROI was suboptimal.

## Business Impact
- 10% of in-app donors generate >85% of revenue → losing or disengaging this group would have disproportionate impact  
- Traditional donors had high inactivity (67% inactive >180 days), threatening ongoing contributions  
- Campaign inefficiencies and poorly targeted outreach risked both revenue and donor trust  
- Improving retention and targeting could materially increase revenue while reducing donor fatigue  

For any organisation relying on recurring contributions, this represents both a **financial and reputational challenge**.

## My Analytical Intervention
I redesigned donor engagement strategy from a generic, uniform approach to a **behaviour-driven, predictive, and personalised framework**, organised into three strategic pillars:

1. **Personalised Outreach**  
   - Reactivate one-time and younger donors using campaign updates linked to past causes  
   - Retain high-value app donors (“whales” and “dolphins”) with behaviour-based reminders  
   - Engage younger in-app donors with genre-aligned messages (Adventure, MMORPG)  
   - Use Generative AI for scalable message drafting under human oversight and compliance  

2. **Predictive Retention for Traditional Donors**  
   - Implement predictive RFM-scoring to classify donors into alert tiers (Cannot Lose → Red Alert)  
   - Trigger tailored retention interventions by contribution tier and demographics  
   - Integrate AI-assisted personalisation within GDPR-compliant frameworks  

3. **Tiered Incentives & Early Activation**  
   - Retain whales with exclusive bundles and recognition; motivate dolphins with progression rewards  
   - Engage minnows early with low-cost starter packs or micro-bonuses  
   - Trigger first-purchase incentives within two weeks to build loyalty  
   - Use streaks, loyalty badges, and genre-specific rewards to sustain engagement  

Old logic → new logic: uniform campaigns → targeted, behaviour-based engagement and predictive retention.

## Demonstration of Skills and Capabilities
This project demonstrates my ability to:  
- Integrate and clean multiple datasets from diverse sources  
- Design actionable RFM and behaviour-based donor segmentation  
- Develop predictive retention logic for traditional donors  
- Translate analytics into **concrete, operational campaigns** with measurable impact  
- Apply AI responsibly for scalable, GDPR-compliant personalisation  
- Balance revenue optimisation with donor experience and long-term engagement  

These skills are directly applicable to marketing analytics, CRM, growth, and retention roles.

## Evidence and Validation
- Segmentation and predictive tiers identified at-risk and high-value donors accurately  
- Channel allocation decisions validated through historical engagement and response metrics  
- AI-assisted personalisation tested on small cohorts for effectiveness and compliance  
- Assumptions stress-tested across seasonal patterns and donor demographics  

All validation focused on **business relevance and decision confidence**, not technical metrics alone.

## Resulting Business Outcomes
- Improved retention of high-value in-app donors, protecting key revenue streams  
- Increased engagement among younger or one-time donors through targeted campaigns  
- Optimised campaign efficiency with better channel allocation (email, social, direct mail)  
- Maintained compliance and donor trust, reducing reputational risk  
- Designed interventions with **both immediate revenue impact and long-term donor sustainability**

## Why This Matters to a Hiring Manager
This project shows that I can:  
- Identify hidden revenue and engagement risks in multi-channel donor data  
- Turn analytics into **actionable strategies that influence decisions**  
- Integrate data, predictive modelling, and AI responsibly  
- Communicate insights and interventions in a way stakeholders can implement  

These capabilities are transferable to any role requiring **data-informed marketing, CRM, or retention strategy**.
